## To-Do List

This project is a simple **To-Do List** built using **Qt** and **SQLite** for managing tasks. The app allows users to add tasks, set their priority and deadline, mark them as complete, and delete them. Tasks are saved in a local SQLite database.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a description, priority, and deadline.
- **View Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in a table with columns for description, priority, deadline, completion status, and a delete option.
- **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as complete via a checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted from the UI and the database using a delete button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in an SQLite database, ensuring that they are preserved across app sessions.
